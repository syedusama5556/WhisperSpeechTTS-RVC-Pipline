# StyleGAN Implementations
DLAS supports two different StyleGAN2 implementations:

- [@rosinality implementation](https://github.com/rosinality/stylegan2-pytorch/commits/master)
  Designed to reach parity with the nVidia reference implementation in TF1.5
- [@lucidrains implementation](https://github.com/lucidrains/stylegan2-pytorch)
  Designed with simplicity and readability in mind.
  
I prefer the readability of @lucidrains implementation, but you cannot (yet) use pretrained weights
with it. I'm working on that.
