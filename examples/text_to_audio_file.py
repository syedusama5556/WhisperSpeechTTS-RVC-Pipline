'''
Simple example that speaks some text and creates an audio file named output_audio.wav in the same directory in which the script is run.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS~

pip install WhisperSpeech
pip install pydub

IMPORTANT~

WhisperSpeech installs pytorch by default, but the cpu-only version.  If you want to use gpu-acceleration, after WhisperSpeech installs
go to this website and find the appropriate command to run:

import numpy as np
from whisperspeech.pipeline import Pipeline

pipe = Pipeline(s2a_ref='collabora/whisperspeech:s2a-q4-small-en+pl.model')

# pipe = Pipeline(s2a_ref='collabora/whisperspeech:s2a-q4-base-en+pl.model')

audio_tensor = pipe.generate("""
 This is some sample text.  You would add text here that you want spoken and then only leave one of the above lines ununcommented for the model you want to test.  Note that this script does not rely on the standard method within the whisperspeech pipeline.  Rather, it replaces a part of the functionality with reliance on pydub instead.  This approach "just worked."  Feel free to modify or distribute at your pleasure.
